# Wagon
@blur
You spend the night inside the wagon.
@hide MainBackground wait!
@blur power:0
When you wake up it's already noon. The wagon is so comfy you can't force yourself to get out...[i] Wait, it is moving!
While you were sleeping the wagon took off and now you're in the canyon.

# Inn
@shake Camera
You storm into the inn starling the folks inside. Your disgusting appearance and creepy behavior makes them stay away and you rest till the morning.
@hide MainBackground wait!
The next day, however, you're thrown away from the town.
The town is no longer available, but the journey continues!
